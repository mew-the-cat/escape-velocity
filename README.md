# Escape Velocity

Escape Velocity is a 2D turn-based survival browser game in a sci-fi setting. Your starship was heavily damaged during a savage orbital battle. Pilots managed to perform an emergency landing.. or (better so say) a fall on a planet. The vessel is irreversibly damaged, engines are down, comms are not responding, most of the crew is dead, the remaining ones are heavily wounded... 

You find yourself in the middle of the endless jungle covering essentially the entire surface. 
* Repair the emergency beacon
* Unravel mysterious of the green planet
* Beware of its dark secrets
* Get a way out this hell
